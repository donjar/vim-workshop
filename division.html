      In the set of rational numbers, dividing by zero does not make sense. For
      example, 1/0 is not defined. The same goes with the set of real and
      complex numbers.

      However, what if we decide to define it anyways? In particular, from the
      set of real numbers, let us define the value "infinity" to a positive
      number divided by 0, and let us define the value "negative infinity" to a
      negative number divided by 0.
    </div>

    <div>
      What we get is called the set of extended real numbers. Such a definition
      is useful for various areas of mathematics, for example integration. We
      still cannot meaningfully define some statements though, such as infinity
      divided by infinity.
